## 2. Design the Class Interface

```python
# EXAMPLE

class Reminder:
    # User-facing properties:
    #   name: string

    def __init__(self, name):
        # Parameters:
        #   name: string
        # Side effects:
        #   Sets the name property of the self object
        pass # No code here yet

    def remind_me_to(self, task):
        # Parameters:
        #   task: string representing a single task
        # Returns:
        #   Nothing
        # Side-effects
        #   Saves the task to the self object
        pass # No code here yet

    def remind(self):
        # Returns:
        #   A string reminding the user to do the task
        # Side-effects:
        #   Throws an exception if no task is set
        pass # No code here yet
```
